# Bingo
This is a simple bingo caller and called number tracker.

The code is mostly an adaptation of [mgilson's](https://github.com/mgilson) answer to [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13383938/bingo-number-check)

I added a couple of additional functions to make the game more user-friendly, and to enable the use of different game modes (such as four corners or blackout). 

The batch file simply runs the program with a pause at the end, allowing you for a smoother exit from the program at game finish, and leaves the game on the screen for a moment in case you accidentally exited prematurely.
